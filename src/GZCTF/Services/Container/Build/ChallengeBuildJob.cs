/// <see cref="GZCTF.Models.Data.GameChallenge.AdCheckerImage"/>), and the queue
/// dedups on (ChallengeId, Kind) so the two don't collide.

// Serialize as a string ("Challenge"/"Checker") in API responses, matching the
// sibling build enums (ChallengeBuildStatus, BuildTrigger) so the admin Builds UI
// can compare kind === 'Checker' instead of a brittle numeric 0/1.
