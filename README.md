GZ::CTF is an open source CTF platform based on ASP.NET Core.

Administrator guide: [Discord message configuration, pre-start testing and scoreboard visibility](docs/admin-discord-testing.md).

> [!NOTE]
>
> **This is a fork of GZ::CTF that adds an Attack & Defense and King of the Hill engine** on top of the upstream jeopardy platform. A single game can freely mix jeopardy, A&D, and KotH challenges.
>
> - ⚔️ **Attack & Defense** — tick-based rounds, per-team service containers + bridges, a rotating `/flag`, an enochecker3 SLA checker, and WireGuard VPN access.
> - 👑 **King of the Hill** — one shared hill the whole game fights to control by planting a per-round token in `/koth/king`; hold a healthy hill to earn points.
> - 📦 **Challenge authoring** — ready-to-edit templates, a `challenge.yml` schema, `.gzevent` manifests, and GitHub repo bindings that auto-import on push.
>
> **📖 Fork documentation: [https://dimasma0305.github.io/GZCTF/](https://dimasma0305.github.io/GZCTF/)** — setup, the A&D/KotH engine, scoring, challenge authoring, and deployment. For upstream-only features, see the upstream docs linked below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **To save your effort, please read the documentation carefully before using: [https://gzctf.gzti.me/](https://gzctf.gzti.me/)**

> [!WARNING]
>
> **Upgrade and migration considerations:**
>
> 1. To upgrade the platform, simply pull the latest image and restart, and the database migration will be performed automatically.
> 2. In general, **downgrade** operations are not supported. Upgrading versions with a large time span may result in data incompatibility, so **please make sure to back up your data**.
> 3. After the upgrade, there may be new configuration items and changes in file structure. It is recommended to consult the official documentation or the community.
> 4. If you are migrating to another branch project, please pay attention to whether the database structure has changed. **The database after the change does not support rollback to the original version**.
> 5. The community and the official maintainers are not responsible for data loss, data incompatibility, and other issues. For issues with branch projects, please contact the corresponding project maintainer.

## Features 🛠️

- Create highly customizable challenges

  - Type of challenges: Static Attachment, Dynamic Attachment, Static Container, Dynamic Container

    - Static Attachment: Shared attachments, any configured flag can be accepted.
    - Dynamic Attachment: The number of flags and attachments must be at least the number of teams. Attachments and flags are distributed according to the teams.
    - Static Container: Shared container templates, no dynamic flag is issued, and any configured flag can be submitted.
    - Dynamic Container: Automatically generate and issue flags through container environment variables, and flag of each team is unique.

  - Dynamic Scores

    - Curve of scores:

      $$f(S, r, d, x) = \left \lfloor S \times \left[r  + ( 1- r) \times \exp\left( \dfrac{1 - x}{d} \right) \right] \right \rfloor $$

      Where $S$ is the original score, $r$ is the minimum score ratio, $d$ is the difficulty coefficient, and $x$ is the number of submissions. The first three parameters can be customized to satisfy most of the dynamic score requirements.

    - Bonus for first three solves:
      The platform rewards 5%, 3%, and 1% of the current score for the first three solves respectively.

  - Disable or enable challenges during the competition, and release new challenges at any time.
  - Dynamic flag sharing detection, optional flag template, leet flag

- **Teams** score timeline, scoreboard. Teams can be grouped
- Dynamic container distribution, management, and multiple port mapping methods based on **Docker or K8s**
- **Real-time** competition notification, competition events and flag submission monitoring, and log monitoring based on SignalR
- SMTP email verification, malicious registration protection based on Cloudflare Turnstile
- Ban specific user, three-level user permission management
- Optional team review, invitation code, registration email restriction
- Writeup collection, review, and batch download in the platform
- Download exported scoreboard, export all submission records
- Monitor submissions and major event logs during the competition
- Challenges traffic forwarding based on **TCP over WebSocket proxy**, configurable traffic capture
- Cluster cache based on Redis, database storage backend based on PGSQL
- Storage backend based on local disk and **object storage (MinIO, S3, etc.)**
- Customizable global configuration, platform title, record information
- Support for **dark mode**, multiple languages, and custom themes
- Customizable **website footer**, **website favicon**, and **html description** for SEO
- Support metrics and distributed tracing
- And more...

## Demo 🗿

### Attack & Defense + King of the Hill (this fork)

The A&D scoreboard — per-service Attack / SLA / Defense-loss columns under the rarity-pool scoring model, a live score timeline, and a current-round + "next tick" countdown:

![game.ad.scoreboard.webp](assets/images/game.ad.scoreboard.webp)

The King-of-the-Hill scoreboard — per-hill hold points, ticks held, and the current holder, with the same round/tick indicator:

![game.koth.scoreboard.webp](assets/images/game.koth.scoreboard.webp)

The public live attack feed (`/games/{id}/attack`) — every capture and hill takeover animates in real time; also consumable as a plain WebSocket for bots and overlays:

![game.attack.feed.webp](assets/images/game.attack.feed.webp)

The A&D / KotH operator console — round control, container health, flag cycle, and per-team service status:

![admin.ad.ops.webp](assets/images/admin.ad.ops.webp)

Per-challenge A&D configuration — egress, self-reset, the auto-built checker image, and the SSH-requires-a-captured-flag gate:

![admin.ad.challenge.config.webp](assets/images/admin.ad.challenge.config.webp)

Repo bindings — register a GitHub repo and the platform discovers every `.gzevent`, imports each event's challenges, and re-syncs on the configured cadence (the [TCP1PADTesting](https://github.com/TCP1P/TCP1PADTesting) repo is a ready-to-run A&D/KotH example):

![admin.repo.bindings.webp](assets/images/admin.repo.bindings.webp)

Mixed A&D / KotH challenges in one game, and the image-build history (checker images auto-build from `./checker` on import):

![admin.ad.challenges.webp](assets/images/admin.ad.challenges.webp)
![admin.builds.webp](assets/images/admin.builds.webp)

Game settings with the A&D engine knobs (tick length, flag lifetime, warmup, KotH hold points, …):

![admin.game.info.ad.webp](assets/images/admin.game.info.ad.webp)

Bulk-import participants from a CSV and mail each their credentials — a 5-step wizard (upload / map columns / edit & review / options / result) with per-recipient send results and resend-failed:

![admin.users.import.webp](assets/images/admin.users.import.webp)
![admin.users.import.modal.webp](assets/images/admin.users.import.modal.webp)

Per-game cheat analysis (`/games/{id}/monitor/CheatCheck`) — behavioral suspicion scoring, IP/fingerprint anomalies, abnormal-solve and collusion-ring detection, with a per-team suspicion ranking and a filterable global search:

![monitor.cheat.analysis.webp](assets/images/monitor.cheat.analysis.webp)

Anti-cheat block log: logins blocked by the global / per-team IP + browser-fingerprint policy, showing the conflicting teammate and value, with one-click clear for false positives:
